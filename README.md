This is a visualization tool for code. In fact any raw text file that resides in a directory structure can be visualized, but it's mainly for code.

## Introduction

Wading through code is tedious work and getting a quick overview of a code base can be demanding. Codotropic offers you a way to visualize your code base in a different form. Instead of reading code like you usually do, you can digest it in a more visual way.

Start by running generating a projection of the code, after that you can watch the code in your favorite browser *cough* Chrome *cough*.

## Goal of the project

Get a quicker feel for where your complexity is by looking at a code base in visual form. Find large files, overpopulated dirs and other interesting facts about your code base in seconds!

## How to use it

- Install Node.js
- Clone this repo
- Cd into the directory &lt;clone&gt;/server
- Run npm install to add the needed dependencies
- Cd into the directory &lt;clone&gt;/server/lib and run the command 'node codo.js &lt;sourcedir&gt; &lt;outputdir&gt; &lt;extension&gt;'
- Point your browser to the index.html file in the &lt;outputdir&gt; above

## Examples

The example dir contains a codotropic view of the code for this project. The same view can be found in the example.zip file.

## About the name

Codotropic is a [portmanteau](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau) of code base and [phototropic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phototropism). This phrase suggests that the text/code moves towards a state and we can watch snapshots of its movement by visualizing that state.
