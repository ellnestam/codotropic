This is a visualization tool for code. In fact any raw text file that resides in a directory structure can be visualized, but it's mainly for code.

### Introduction

Wading through code is tedious work and getting quick overview of a code base can be even more demanding. Codotropic offers you a way to visualize your code base in an alternate way. Instead of reading the text you can view it in a more abstract way.

Start by running the tool and then you can watch the code in a browser.

## Goal of the project

Get a quick feel for where your complexity is by looking at a code base in visual form.

## How to use it

- Install Node.js
- Clone this repo
- Run npm install to add the needed dependencies
- Cd into the directory <<clone>>/server/lib and run the command 'node codo.js <sourcedir> <outputdir> <filetyp>'
- Point your browser to the index.html file in the <outputdir> above

## Examples

The example dir contains a codotropic view of the code of this project (how's that for meta?). The same view can be found in the example.zip file.

## About the name

Codotropic is a portmanteau of code base and phototropic. This phrase suggests that the text/code moves towards a state and we can watch snapshots of its movement by visualizing that state.
