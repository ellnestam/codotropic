This is a visualization tool for code, or rather text files. 

### Introduction

Run the command ... watch the output

## Goal of the project

Get a quick feel for where your complexity is by looking at a code base in visual form

## How to use it

- clone repo
- run npm install to add dependencies
- cd into the server/lib dir and run the command 'node codo.js <sourcedir> <outputdir> <filetyp>'
- point your browser to the index.html file in the <outputdir> above

## Examples

The example dir contains a codotropic view of the code of this project (how's that for meta?). The same view can be found in the example.zip.


## About the name

Codotropic is a portmanteau of code base and phototropic. This phrase suggests that the text/code moves towards a state and we can watch snapshots of its movement by visualizing that state.
